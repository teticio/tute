Tute card game (WIP)

See https://www.ludoteka.com/clasika/tute.html and https://www.ludoteka.com/clasika/tute-habanero.html for rules (in Spanish).

The idea is to train a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to play this. Hopefully then, I will be able to beat my wife (at the game).

Status: Currently the rlcard python implementation works but is too slow to be interesting. The open_spiel C++ implementation is all ready for me to program the Tute rules but is just a copy & paste of the Hearts game.
